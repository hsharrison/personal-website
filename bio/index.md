# Henry S. Harrison, Sc.B.

Henry is a Ph.D. Candidate in Psychology at the [Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action](http://ione.psy.uconn.edu/) at the [University of Connecticut](http://www.psychology.uconn.edu/).
[Till Frank](http://homepages.uconn.edu/~tif07001/index.html) is Henry's primary Ph.D. advisor.

Previously, he studied at [Brown University](http://www.brown.edu/Departments/CLPS/), graduating in 2009 with a Sc.B. in Cognitive Neuroscience.
After his undergraduate study, he worked for two years as the lab manager at Bill Warren's [Virtual Environment Navigation Library](http://www.cog.brown.edu/research/ven_lab/) before entering the UConn Ph.D. program.

### Research
Henry's research focuses on understanding behavior from the perspective of self-organizing systems.
He is interested in the way that humans and other animals tailor their movements to their surroundings.
These influences includes the layout of affordances (opportunities for action) in the environment, as well as "softer" constraints such as preferences and comfort.

Currently, Henry's two primary lines of research aim to

1. develop a formalism and methodology for combining disparate constraints in dynamical models of behavior, and
2. understand action selection: why are some possibilities for action realized, and not others?

Henry is trained and experienced in a variety of quantitative methods, including nonlinear dynamics, fractal and multifractal analysis, multi-level regression, and timeseries analysis.
He also has experience with motion capture (inertial, magnetic, and camera systems), virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.

### Teaching
A graduate of Michael Turvey's infamous teaching course, Henry enjoys teaching Psychology.
At UConn, he taught laboratory sections to upper-level undergraduates, in which he guided students through the experimental process from developing an idea to running participants to presenting at a poster session.
Additionally, in Fall 2014 he was the lecturer for *General Psychology I* at UConn's Hartford campus.
In Spring 2016, he will be a Visiting Lecturer at Trinity College, where he will take over Bill Mace's course *Perception Laboratory*.

### Scientific computing
Henry is active in the scientific-computing community and has released several [open-source projects](open-source).
Programming in Python, R, and (when necessary) MATLAB, he develops tools for data analysis and data visualization.

He believes that scientists could learn from the open-source community; there is much overlap between the ideals of reproducible research and open-source software.
To this end, Henry makes [his source code](https://github.com/hsharrison) freely available and avoids reliance on specific hardware or expensive, proprietary software for reproducing his analyses.
He has led workshops in scientific programming, version control, and reproducible workflows, and makes himself available to his colleagues for further instruction.

### Personal
Henry grew up in the suburbs of Boston with four younger siblings.
He currently resides in Bolton, CT with his fianc√©e.

Henry's tastes in media (books, television, movies, podcasts, games, Wikipedia-browsing, etc.) reflect a deep (but not exclusive) interest in history and human geography.
When not sciencing or consuming media, he may be traveling, cooking, playing piano, moving heavy objects up and down (weightlifting), or applying his quantitative skills to fantasy sports.
